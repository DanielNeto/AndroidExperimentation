To solve this, don't remove the 'libcom_googlecode_android_scripting_Exec.so ' from the build, it's needed. If you did remove it, then copy it back 
into your workspace: 'PythonAPK\libs\armeabi' and run 'Project->Clean', right click on the PythonAPK project and select 'Close Project', and then 
double click to open it again. Check that it shows up in the Package Explorer window under 'PythonAPK\libs\armeabi'. Alternatively, you can just 
delete the project and import it back in again.

Next right click on the project and select 'Build Path->Configure Build Path', then under 'Java Compiler->Building' make sure 
'Enable Project Specific Settings' is checked. Under 'Build Path Problems' uncheck 'Abort build when build path errors occur' or change 'Incomplete 
build path' from Error to Warning. Click Apply and OK. 

The red 'X' icon appearing on the project in the Project Explorer window should change to a yellow '!' icon for warning instead of error. If it 
didn't, close and reopen the project (or restart Eclipse). On Windows, if you have a thumbnail file inside a build directory, you'll see a red X over 
that directory which will also prevent the build from occurring - just right click and delete the thumbnail file.
